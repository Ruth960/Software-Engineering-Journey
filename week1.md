My first week in the TUM-SKIES software engineering program has been an exciting journey into the fundamentals of web development. We covered essential topics in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git, laying the foundation for building interactive and responsive web applications.

### HTML Basics: Structuring the Web
We started with HTML, the backbone of any webpage. Some of the key elements we explored included:

- **HTML Elements and Tags**: Understanding how to structure content using headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), lists (`<ul>` and `<ol>`), and images (`<img>`).
- **Forms and Input Fields**: Creating user input fields with `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, and submitting data using `<form>`.
- **Tables**: Using `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, and `<th>` to present data in a structured way.

### CSS: Styling the Web
After structuring the content, we moved on to styling with CSS. Some important concepts we covered were:

- **Flexbox and CSS Grid**: Layout techniques to create flexible and responsive designs. I previously struggled with understanding Flexbox, but this week, I finally grasped the concept fully!
- **Media Queries**: Making websites adapt to different screen sizes for a better user experience.
- **CSS Animations and Transitions**: Using keyframes and transformations to create smooth effects and enhance UI interactions.

### JavaScript: Bringing Interactivity to Webpages
JavaScript plays a crucial role in making webpages dynamic. We learned:

- **Basic JavaScript Concepts**: Variables, functions, and arrays.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Using JavaScript to dynamically update webpage content and styles.
- **Handling User Input**: Responding to user actions like button clicks and form submissions.

### Version Control with Git and GitHub
A major highlight of the week was learning Git and GitHub, which are essential for tracking changes and collaborating on projects. Some key commands we practiced included:

- `git clone <repository_url>`: Cloning a repository from GitHub to our local machine.
- `git add .`: Staging all changes for the next commit.
- `git commit -m "Commit message"`: Committing changes with a meaningful message.
- `git push`: Uploading our changes to the remote repository.
- `git pull`: Fetching and merging changes from the remote repository to our local machine.

### Reflections and Takeaways
This first week has been an insightful start to my web development journey. The combination of structured learning and hands-on practice has given me confidence in building simple web pages and understanding the importance of version control. I look forward to the coming weeks as we dive deeper into more advanced topics!
